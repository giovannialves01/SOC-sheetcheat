ZAP is a tool for scanning web applications, it's free and open source. You would prefer zap than burp because you`ll save $500 bucks, burp limits a lot burp community.

I prefer use brave, so need some configurations. Brave is usefull for block out of scope adsense in the pages, you can configure that in zap in Options > Network > Global Exclusions

in kali you can use: 

- apt install brave-browser -y
- apt install zaproxy -y

restart the computer

it's all, you don't need follow the following steps

install extension switchyomega in brave, make sure the proxy are localhost 8080

open zap

for darkmode, search for "Dynamically switch the look and feel" usually in the right side of an engine icon.

the default configuration cant use ssl connections, you need to save a certificate file generated by zap and import in browser. In options(engine icon), search for Network > Server Certificate, save the certificate where you want, import in the brave.
